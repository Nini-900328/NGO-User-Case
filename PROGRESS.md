## Current Issues
- Working on implementing forgot password functionality
- Need to complete authentication flow integration

## Technical Configuration

### Database Setup
- **Server**: ngo-sqlserver (Docker container)
- **Database**: NGOPlatformDb
- **Connection String**: `Server=ngo-sqlserver;Database=NGOPlatformDb;User Id=sa;Password=P@sswords715981432;TrustServerCertificate=True;`
- **Status**: ✅ Connected and operational

### Docker Environment
- **devcontainer**: ASP.NET Core 8.0 development environment
  - Ports: 5000 (HTTP), 5001 (HTTPS)
  - Working directory: /workspace
- **sqlserver**: SQL Server 2022
  - Port: 1433
  - Data persistence: sqlserver_ngo_data volume
- **Network**: Both containers in same Docker network for internal communication

### Development Tools
- **DBeaver**: Successfully connected to SQL Server for database management
- **WSL**: Windows Subsystem for Linux for Docker development
- **Git**: Feature branch workflow with rebase strategy

## Problem Resolution Log

### Database Connection Issues
**Problem**: Kerberos authentication errors with `Trusted_Connection=True`
**Solution**: Changed to SQL Server authentication with sa account

**Problem**: "Cannot open database NGOPlatformDb" login failures
**Solution**: Verified container network and updated connection string

**Problem**: "Invalid object name 'RegularSuppliesNeeds'"
**Solution**: Updated connection string to use NGOPlatformDb instead of master database

### File Path Issues
**Problem**: .bak file restoration failed with Windows path references
**Solution**: Used Docker cp to transfer file and specified Linux container paths for restoration

## Next Steps
- [ ] Complete forgot password implementation
- [ ] Test email sending functionality
- [ ] Update user authentication flow
- [ ] Add proper error handling for authentication
- [ ] Create unit tests for authentication features
- [ ] Review and optimize database queries

## Development Notes
- Project uses Chinese comments and naming conventions
- Default routing points to Case controller (case-centric system)
- Cookie-based authentication with 2-hour expiration
- Team collaboration through GitHub with feature branch workflow
- Database contains both User and Case entities for different user types

## Team Collaboration
- **Repository**: https://github.com/yiqu26/NGO-User-Case.git
- **Branch Strategy**: main → develop → feature branches
- **Current Feature**: feature/forgot-password
- **Database Backup**: 0709v2.bak (restored successfully)
